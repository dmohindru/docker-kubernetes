What is docker compose?
-----------------------
1. Separate CLI that gets installed along with Docker.
2. Used to start up multiple Docker containers at the same time.
3. Automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to 'docker run'.

Basic workflow to use Docker compose
------------------------------------
1. docker-compose.yml file contains all the docker containers related commands like building, running, port mapping etc.
2. Then docker-compose.yml file is passed to docker-compose cli to startup multiple containers.

Basic structure of docker
-------------------------
1. At parent level we specify containers we wish to create.
2. For each container we have instructions how to build/run a container
Eg.
redis-server
  Make it using the 'redis' image
node-app
  Make it using the Dockerfile in the current directory
  Map port 8081 to 8081

Important:
1. Refer to docker-compose.yml file of this section to see example and explanation of each section.
2. Refer to comments in index.js file line 5-6 which explanation how to specify an address of a service required by an app which is managed by docker compose.
