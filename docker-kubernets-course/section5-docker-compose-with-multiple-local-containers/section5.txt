What is docker compose?
-----------------------
1. Separate CLI that gets installed along with Docker.
2. Used to start up multiple Docker containers at the same time.
3. Automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to 'docker run'.

Basic workflow to use Docker compose
------------------------------------
1. docker-compose.yml file contains all the docker containers related commands like building, running, port mapping etc.
2. Then docker-compose.yml file is passed to docker-compose cli to startup multiple containers.

Basic structure of docker
-------------------------
1. At parent level we specify containers we wish to create.
2. For each container we have instructions how to build/run a container
Eg.
redis-server
  Make it using the 'redis' image
node-app
  Make it using the Dockerfile in the current directory
  Map port 8081 to 8081

Important:
1. Refer to docker-compose.yml file of this section to see example and explanation of each section.
2. Refer to comments in index.js file line 5-6 which explanation how to specify an address of a service required by an app which is managed by docker compose.

Docker compose commands
------------------------
Important: All these command should be executed from a folder containing docker-compose.yml file

Launch multiple container with docker-compose
# docker-compose up

First build an image and then Launch multiple container with docker-compose
# docker-compose up --build

Launch multiple containers in background
# docker-compose up -d

Stop containers
# docker-compose down

View status of running containers in a docker compose
# docker-compose ps

Docker compose Restart Policy
-----------------------------
See docker-compose.yml file of this section to see usage of restart policy

- "no" (default): Never attempt to restart this container if it stops or crashes. Notice inverted commas around no it is required for a valid yml file. 
- always: If this container stops *for any reason* always attempt to restart it
- on-failure: Only restart if the container stops with an error code
- unless-stopped: Always restart unless we (the developers) forcibly stop it
