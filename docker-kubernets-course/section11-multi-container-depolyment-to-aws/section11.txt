Deploying multi container app to AWS Beanstalk
----------------------------------------------
1. We need to create a file Dockerrun.aws.json file
2. This file would contain instruction called container definition how to pull docker images from Dockerhub run those images.
3. Behind the seen AWS Beanstalk does't know how to run docker images but rather delegates this task to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
4. ECS need task definition for each docker container it need to run.
