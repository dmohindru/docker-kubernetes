What is Kubernetes?
-------------------
System for running many different containers over multiple different machines.

Why use Kubernetes?
-------------------
When you need to run many different containers with different images.

Working with Kubernetes in Development vs Production
-----------------------------------------------------
Development
- minikube

Production
- Managed solutions
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)
  - Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Do it yourself

Components of minikube
----------------------
- minikube: Use to managing the VM itself
- kubectl: Use for managing containers in the node

Local Kubernetes Development workflow
-------------------------------------
1. Install Kubectl: CLI for interacting with our master.
2. Install a VM driver virtualbox: Used to make a VM that will be your single node.
3. Install minikube: Runs a single node on that VM.

Mapping knowledge of Docker Compose and Kubernetes
---------------------------------------------------
Docker Compose
  1. Each entry can optionally get docker-compose to build an image.
  2. Each entry represents a container we want to create.
  3. Each entry defines the networking requirements (ports).
Kubernetes
  1. Kubernetes expects all images to already be built. Make sure our image is hosted on docker hub.
  2. One config file per object we want to create. Make one config file to create the container.
  3. We have to manually set up all networking. Make one config file to set up networking.
