System for running many different containers over multiple different machines.

Why use Kubernetes?

When you need to run many different containers with different images.

Working with Kubernetes in Development vs Production
-----------------------------------------------------
Development
- minikube

Production
- Managed solutions
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)
  - Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Do it yourself

Components of minikube
----------------------
- minikube: Use to managing the VM itself
- kubectl: Use for managing containers in the node

Local Kubernetes Development workflow
-------------------------------------
1. Install Kubectl: CLI for interacting with our master.
2. Install a VM driver virtualbox: Used to make a VM that will be your single node.
3. Install minikube: Runs a single node on that VM.
