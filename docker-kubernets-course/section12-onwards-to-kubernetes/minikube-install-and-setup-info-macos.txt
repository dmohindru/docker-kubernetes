Updated Minikube Install and Setup Info - macOS
2-22-2021

In the upcoming lecture, we will set up and install Minikube using Homebrew. The installation instructions have changed slightly. If you are already using Docker Desktop's Kubernetes, you do not need Minikube and these instructions can be skipped.

Install Minikube with Homebrew

First, make sure you have Homebrew installed. If not, follow the instructions here:

https://brew.sh/

Then, in your terminal, run:

brew install minikube

Your output should look something like this (it will be ok if it is not exact)

Install Minikube Directly

If you do not wish to use Homebrew, you can use cURL to download the binaries.

In your terminal, run:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-darwin-amd64

sudo install minikube-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

Starting Minikube and Testing Installation

After you have successfully installed Minikube we need to start and test the cluster to make sure everything is working correctly.

1. Start with VM driver:
In your terminal, run:
# minikube start --driver=hyperkit
Your output should look similar to this:
Note - It is very important to use a vm driver like hyperkit. If you do not pass a driver flag to the start command Minikube will use the docker driver instead. This will not match what is shown in the course and will not work with an ingress (used later).

2. Check Minikube Status
After you see a Done! message in your terminal, run 
# minikube status 
to make sure the cluster is healthy. Pay particular attention that the apiserver is in a "Running" state.

3. Check kubectl
Lastly, open up your terminal and make sure that you can run 
# kubectl version

Note - the client and server can be off by one minor version without error or issue.
