Typical application development and deployment workflow
-------------------------------------------------------
Its an iterative process with below steps in order
1. Development
  1.1 Create/change features branch
  1.2 Make changes on a non-master branch
  1.3 Push to github
  1.4 Create Pull request to merge with master
2. Testing
  2.1 Code pushed to Travis CI (or any other CI provider for that matter)
  2.2 Run Tests
  2.3 Merge PR with master
3. Deployment
  3.1 Code pushed to Travis CI (or any other CI provider for that matter)
  3.2 Run Tests
  3.3 Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Command related to react front-end app
---------------------------------------
Create react app
# npx create-react-app frontend

Run tests
# npm run test

Start app for local development
# npm run start

Build app for production deployment
# npm run build

Docker volumes
--------------
# docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image_id>
Little bit of explanation about -v flag
-v flag is used to mount a directory in a local computer to a directory inside a container.
eg. -v $(pwd):/app 
This options maps the current working directory to a /app directory inside a container
However if : is missing in -v flag then this is message to docker to not map a given directory inside a container to any directory in local computer
eg. -v /app/node_modules
Tell Docker not to map this directory to any folder on a local computer

Important: See docker-compose.yml file for a work around of specifying -v and -f options in docker run command
