What is Docker?
Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers
It an ecosystem with following components
- Docker Client
- Docker Server
- Docker Machine
- Docker Images
- Docker Hub
- Docker Compose

What is an image?
Single file with all the deps and config required to run a program
Image consists of broadly two component
1. File System snaphot
2. Startup Command

What is a container?
Its a instance of an image. Runs a program. An isolated machine with its own set of resources (harddrive, cpu, memory, network, etc)

What Docker for Mac consists of?
Docker Client: Tool (Docker CLI) that we are going to issue command to Docker Server (Docker Daemon)

Docker Server: Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc 

Docker Client (via CLI) ------> Docker Server

Meaning of this docker command?
# docker run hello-world
This command spins up a container with an image hello-world

What are the series of steps followed with below command is issued?
# docker run hello-world

Steps
1. This comamnd is read by docker client and sent to docker server. Basically terminal docker command is a docker client.
2. Docker server then checks for the image called hello-world in its local cache.
3. If an image hello-world is not found in local chache then this image is pulled from docker-hub, a free cloud server which host public images that can be download and run on local computer. Docker server then caches this image locally.
4. Docker server then spin up a new container with this image.
5. Container then does its work according to image.

Some important key terms very specific to Linux OS
1. Namespacing: Isolating resources per process (or group of process). For example isolating a portion of hard disk for an exclusive use of a process.
2. Contol Group: Limit the amount of resources used per process. For example limiting Memory, CPU Usage, HD I/O, Network Bandwidth to a process or group of process.

Important
When a docker server is running on your computer say Mac. Then actually its running a linux OS in a virtual machine. Examine the content under Server section of following command.
# docker version
you will find this info "OS/Arch: linux/amd64"
